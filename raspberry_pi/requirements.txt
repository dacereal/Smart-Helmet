# Drowsiness Detection Service Requirements for Raspberry Pi 5
# Install with: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# NOTE: opencv-python is installed via system package (python3-opencv)
#       during setup.sh - it's faster and more reliable than pip install

# ONNX Runtime (optimized for ARM64)
onnxruntime>=1.16.0

# OpenCV for image processing - Use system package instead of pip
# System package installed via: sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
# If you need pip version, uncomment below (SLOW - ~45MB download):

# Flask for REST API
flask>=3.0.0
flask-cors>=4.0.0

# NumPy for array operations
numpy>=1.24.0

# Raspberry Pi Camera support
picamera2>=0.3.12  # Modern Pi Camera library
# Note: On older Pi OS, you may need to use legacy picamera instead

# GPIO control for vibration motor
gpiozero>=1.6.2  # Modern GPIO library (preferred)
# Alternative: RPi.GPIO>=0.7.0  # Legacy GPIO library (fallback)

# Optional: For better performance
